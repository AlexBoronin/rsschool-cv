===========================================

> - Hello. I am Alexey. I am 42 years old, I live in Minsk, I am married and have two children.\
>   Some time ago (due to certain circumstances) I had to drastically change the vector of application of efforts and revise my life goals. There is no experience as such in the IT field, but nothing can prevent a person from gaining new knowledge and experience in any field. And since the IT industry is not only rapidly developing and penetrating into all corners of our lives, but also unites people from all over the world regardless of age, gender and other qualifications, the choice has become obvious. I think that my **inherent perseverance**, multiplied by **the desire to learn** new things, and **diligence**, will help me achieve my goal - to become a worthy representative of one of the IT-professions.
